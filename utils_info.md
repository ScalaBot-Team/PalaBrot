# How to use Mongodb  

Install docker-compose and docker. 

In the Dockerfile there is information about the port, root's name and root's password. (We need to change it in a future). 

To run the image: `docker-compose up` in the dir where the file `docker-compose` is. 

To "enter" to the debian:  `docker exec -it palabrot_mongodb_1 bash`
